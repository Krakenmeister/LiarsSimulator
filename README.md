# Liar's Simulator

A console-based simulator for the popular game [Liar's Bar](https://store.steampowered.com/app/3097560/Liars_Bar/) built in Typescript. Accompanying UI visualization coming soon. Planned for an open script-writing competition.

New scripts/strategies can be created in the bots folder and extend the Player class. A well-documented example can be found in bots/Example.ts. Run a simulation from Simulator.ts, and place the desired configuration settings there as well.
